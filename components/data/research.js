        description: "In 2023, two separate attempts are being planned for rowers crossing the Indian Ocean. Working in collaboration with the rower, our goal is to explore how best to navigate the crossing on a day-to-day basis, accounting for forecast currents, wind and wave conditions - and the uncertainty in each input. Stochastic optimal control techniques will be used."

I developed an application to automatically analyse and visualise student data. These visualisaions were then used to inform students of their engagement levels, and how they could improve.",
