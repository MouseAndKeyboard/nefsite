                Coders for Causes is the largest software engineering volunteer group in Western Australia. 
                I have now been volunteering with Coders for Causes for nearly 3 years. In 2020 I had the privilege of being elected as the President of the organisation. 
                As president, I was responsible for the organisation of the group, including the organisation of events, the management of the group's finances, client management, and the recruitment of new members.

              While working at the UWA System Health Lab as research engineer, my colleague and I developed a full-stack web app to streamline the course accreditation process. The app was developed using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. There are plans to expand the scope of the app to include other UWA faculties.
